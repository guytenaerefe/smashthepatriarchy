Hey @$NAME, you said $BAD but don't you mean $GOOD
How insensitive. It's 2016 you know, @$NAME? I'm sure you meant to say $GOOD instead of $BAD
@$NAME, you COULD say $BAD, but it think it would be a better world if you'd use $GOOD instead
Yo @$NAME, to make living with eachother more bearable you could substitute $BAD for $GOOD
