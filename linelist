Hey @$NAME, you said $BAD but it would be really nice if you could use $GOOD instead
Hi @$NAME, I'm raising awareness about gender biased words. Did you know you could say $GOOD instead of $BAD
@$NAME, you COULD say $BAD, but it think it would be a better world if you'd use $GOOD instead
Yo @$NAME, no offense but what do you think about using $GOOD instead of $BAD?
@$NAME, using $GOOD instead of $BAD yields the same result, but without hurting anyone
