# Experimental twitter bot in ruby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guytenaerefe/smashthepatriarchy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guytenaerefe/smashthepatriarchy)

* `bundle install`
* Place a `config.yml` with consumer_key/secret and access_token/secret in project root (See `config.yml.example`)

## Contact
If you see this insane bad code and you are pulling your hair, crying to yourself, hoping Why never read this, please
feel free to strike down with righteous education. Only do this if you are not heavily invested in the tissuemarket, or
if you're a stockbroker for said market and know what you are doing.

This bot is based on my dear pal Aengus Walton's [grammer_man](https://github.com/kopf/grammer_man), written in python. 

## Run test
Run the single puny test with `rake`. Oh it will fail! (_hint:_ `echo "707682618209341440" > tweets.done`)

## Todo
* Need to find a way to mock the twitter connection so I can include it in my tests;
* OR need to add all my twitter tokens in Travis. Ok bye!

Does nothing yet! _Surprise!_
